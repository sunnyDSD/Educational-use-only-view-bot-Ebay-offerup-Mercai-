# Multi-Platform View Bot (eBay, Mercari, OfferUp)

## Features
- **Multi-Platform Support**: Works with eBay, Mercari, and OfferUp.
- **User-Agent Rotation**: Helps avoid detection by rotating between various user-agent strings.
- **Cloudflare Bypass**: Uses `cloudscraper` to bypass basic Cloudflare protection.
- **Customizable View Limits**: Limits the maximum number of views per request to avoid abuse.
